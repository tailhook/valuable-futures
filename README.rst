Valuable-futures crate
======================

:Status: Alpha
:Documentation: http://docs.rs/valuable_futures/

A library that allows writing futures_ having a by-value state
(or type-safe futures
inspired by `#458 <https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-rs/issues/458>`_).
This is very useful for implemention futures as state machines or enums.
